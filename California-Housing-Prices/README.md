# California Housing Prices Prediction

This project demonstrates how to use AutoGluon to predict California housing prices based on a provided dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is located in the `/content/CaliforniaHousingPrices/` directory and contains training and testing data with various features related to properties in California, including:

-   Property details (Address, Type, Year built, etc.)
-   Interior and exterior features (Heating, Cooling, Parking, Lot, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, etc.)
-   School information (Elementary, Middle, and High School scores and distances)
-   Tax information (Tax assessed value, Annual tax amount)
-   Listing and sales history (Listed On, Listed Price, Last Sold On, Last Sold Price)
-   Location information (City, Zip, State)

The target variable for prediction is the 'Sold Price'.

## Methodology

The project utilizes the AutoGluon library for automated machine learning. The steps involved are:

1.  **Data Loading**: Load the training and testing data into pandas DataFrames.
2.  **Data Exploration**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's structure, data types, and summary statistics.
3.  **Model Training**: Initialize and train an AutoGluon `TabularPredictor` on the training data. The `best_quality` preset is used to automatically train and ensemble a variety of models for optimal performance, with a specified time limit. The target variable is 'Sold Price'.
4.  **Prediction**: Use the trained predictor to make predictions on the unseen test data.
5.  **Submission File Generation**: Create a submission file in the required format, containing the predicted 'Sold Price' for each property in the test set.

## Evaluation Metric

For this regression task (predicting a continuous value), the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was automatically chosen by AutoGluon as the primary evaluation metric to optimize model performance. RMSE measures the average magnitude of the prediction errors.

## Results

The performance of the trained models can be viewed in the leaderboard generated by `predictor.fit_summary()`. The best performing model based on the validation RMSE is typically a weighted ensemble of several individual models trained by AutoGluon.

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have the necessary dataset in the `/content/CaliforniaHousingPrices/` directory.
2.  Run the code cells in this notebook sequentially.
3.  The notebook will install AutoGluon, load and explore the data, train the model, make predictions, and generate a `submission.csv` file in the `/content/CaliforniaHousingPrices/` directory.

## Dependencies

-   pandas
-   autogluon

These dependencies are installed at the beginning of the notebook using `pip`.
