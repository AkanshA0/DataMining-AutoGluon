# AutoGluon Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects demonstrating the use of the **AutoGluon** library for both classification and regression tasks. Each project is contained within its own directory and includes a dedicated dataset, notebook, and detailed README.

## üìÅ Projects Overview

Below are the projects included in this repository. Please navigate to a project's directory to see the full implementation and analysis.

### 1. IEEE Fraud Detection

* **Description:** A **classification** project to detect fraudulent online transactions using the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset. This project demonstrates a complete workflow using AutoGluon, from data preprocessing and sampling to model training and prediction.
* **Task:** Classification
* **Go to project:** **[View Details](./IEEE-Fraud-Detection/README.md)**

### 2. California Housing Prices Prediction

* **Description:** A **regression** project to predict housing prices in California. This notebook uses AutoGluon to automatically train and ensemble a variety of models, optimizing for Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to achieve the best performance.
* **Task:** Regression
* **Go to project:** **[View Details](./California-Housing-Prices/README.md)**

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Technology

Both projects leverage **AutoGluon**, an open-source, easy-to-use automated machine learning (AutoML) library. It simplifies the process of model training, hyperparameter tuning, and ensembling by automatically finding the best models for your data with minimal code.
